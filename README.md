# smaio-vim

This repository contains a bunch of configuration files for a bunch of
programs. For vim I use `vundle` as the plugin manager.

## Programs Used

1. vim
2. tmux
3. zathura

### Requirements

The version of `vim` I'm using is 8.1+. I'm also using [vundle](vundle) to
manager my vim plugins. Gutentags requires [ctags](ctags) to be installed;
fortunately, the requirements for ctags are pretty easy to find.

## Future Plans

I may update this later on to install everything that I need if that's, but as
I'm already beginning to think about it I realize that this would be a pretty
significant task.
